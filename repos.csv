* Standardize optional dependency handling

- Add `_check_module_importable` helper in `_utils/_import_utils.py`

- moscot: guard the runtime import in `from_moscot()` with the new helper
- adjustText: replace silent `logg.error` with a proper
  `ModuleNotFoundError` pointing to `pip install cellrank[plot]`
- tqdm: remove triple fallback chain; `tqdm` is always available as a
  hard dependency of scanpy

* Move _check_module_importable to top-level imports

* Move tqdm to top-level import in _parallelize.py

* Remove resolved issue comment (#1033) from adjust_text call

* Skip adjust_text test when adjustText not installed

* Add adjustText to test deps instead of skipping

* ci: install plot extra in conda job

The conda job now raises on missing `adjustText` instead of
silently skipping.  Use `pip install -e '.[plot]'` so the
